TIMING-16#84 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.506 ns between adau1761_codec/i2c_interface/Inst_i2s_data_interface/new_sample_reg/C (clocked by clkout0) and wd_top/wc/count_flip_flop/q_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
